## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Or at least I tried)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I improved my skills of semantic HTML by using landmark tags like <main> and <footer> instead of the generic ones like <div>.
Also, I got to practice using flexbox to stylize my page, which is good because I was not used to it yet.
